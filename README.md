# salmon_cookies

**Author**: Suzanne Leber
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
My friend 'Pat' has a business idea for selling a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies. Pat needs help with branding and some internal data management. Pat needs to be able to add and remove locations from the daily projections report, and easily modify the input numbers for each location based on the day of the week and other factors, in a web application. In addition to building an application that calculates daily sales projections for each store location (in a file called sales.html), I also need to create a public-facing page (in index.html) that is pretty, useful, and informative.
